# Klean

**Klean** is a mobile application designed to help users assess the **safety standards of cosmetic products** by analyzing their ingredient lists.

## 🧠 How It Works

Klean leverages **state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs)** to evaluate the safety of cosmetic ingredients. Here's the strategy:

1. **Ingredient Analysis**: A wide range of cosmetic ingredients are analyzed using 3 powerful LLMs.
2. **Consensus Mechanism**: Each LLM gives a safety judgment independently.
3. **Majority Vote**: The final safety decision is made using a **majority voting** system across the 3 LLMs, ensuring robustness and accuracy.
